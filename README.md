What are Dice Dreams free rolls? 
Dice Dreams is a game all about gathering resources, battling your friends, and building an impressive kingdom from your earnings. The name of the game (literally) is those dice, as youâ€™ll be rolling dice to decide your rewards, but quickly run out of dice rolls.

This is the good part, Dice Dreams free rolls are links that unlock more rolls in your game, getting you back in the game and helping you to build up even more resources so you can get back to (virtually) attacking your auntie. These are distributed regularly by the developers over on the Dice Dreams Facebook page, but we have collated them all here so you donâ€™t have to trawl through weeks worth of updates and Facebook posts.
